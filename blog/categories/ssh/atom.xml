    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another short one. In the process of chasing around the issue with getting the SSH to work with Octopress, I inadvertantly deleted the <code>_deploy</code> folder. When I saw the rake task complaining about the folder being missing, I recreated it and (thought) things were well. Then I noticed that my blog was no longer updating. Everything was safe and backed up, so I thought, just blow it away and start over.</p>

<p>What I found during the set up is that the <code>_deploy</code> folder enjoys a special status within the source branch of being pointed at master. This makes sense, given its role, but I didn’t know you could do this with git. Ah, the process of discovery. I’ll have to tuck that little characteristic away for future reference.</p>

<p>At any rate, I seem to be back on track, although one upshot is that I lost my commit history by deleting the old GH repo. I still have the old repo local, at least until I decide to get rid of it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the afore-mentioned spirit of building the boat as it’s moving away from the dock, I’m sort of trying this one on the fly. After switching the remotes, I had expected the deploy to “just work,” since it was pushing to a Github repo. When I deployed, however, it still asked for my GH credentials. Without actually looking at the Rakefile Octopress uses, I had assumed that there was a bit of configuration in the deploy task that was telling it to use a different method. When I actually looked at it, though, no such luck:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby task, task, who has the task?">task :deploy do
  # Check if preview posts exist, which should not be published
  if File.exists?(“.preview-mode”)
    puts “## Found posts in preview mode, regenerating files ...”
    File.delete(“.preview-mode”)
    Rake::Task[:generate].execute
   end

   Rake::Task[:copydot].invoke(source_dir, public_dir)
   Rake::Task[“#{deploy_default}”].execute
 end
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing pertaining to my blog, specifically, to be seen, but there was that <code>deploy_default</code> task. All it said was “push” so not much there either. There was another variable in that block, though, called <code>ssh_user</code> with a default e-mail address in it. I replaced it with the e-mail address I used to create the SSH keys and I’m thinking that might do it, the reasoning being if it tried to push with an invalid SSH setting, GH would fall back to the HTTPS mode. I could be wrong, but I thought I’d give that a whirl.</p>

<p>Sure I could do a search for all this, but I’m in an experimental mood. Let’s see how it goes.</p>

<p><em>Ok, it didn’t work - the deploy still asked for credentials, so I sense a web search in my future. For science!</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, I’ve found the workflow using Octopress to get stuff onto the blog reasonably straightforward. One bit that hangs me up, more for the inconvenience, is having to stop and enter my username &amp; password everytime I deploy or push something to the repo on Github. It’s not a lot, but over the course of a typical session, if I have to do it, say, 6 or 7 times, it gets a little tiresome.</p>

<p>I’ve known for some time that Github makes it possible to set up SSH authentication so that you can sidestep this little hitch in the routine. This seemed like a nice little thing to blog about. Who knows? I never googled it with DuckDuckGo, so there may be a ton of stuff out there on this very topic, but I’m looking for stuff to write about and it beats a page of <a href="http://lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>.</p>

<h3>Establish your keys</h3>

<p>If you haven’t done so already, you need to set up SSH keys locally. I followed the directions <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">here</a>, since I’m using Github. I have plans to explore deploying Jekyll/Octopress blog(s) to a more traditional shared webhosting solution, but for today, it’s Github. I’m using Linux. Mac should be much the same. Windows, out of the box, is a bit stunted in this regard. Your friendly neighborhood search engine should be able to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=setting+up+SSH+on+windows">direct you</a> toward setting up SSH on Windows.</p>

<h3>Change your remote</h3>

<p>Being somewhat lazy (or expeditious, choose), I set up things using the most direct route possible, meaning HTTPS for my github repo. Had I not, you’d be reading <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/catpictures/">something else</a>. Here again, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/">Github spells it out</a>.</p>

<h3>Test your changes</h3>

<p>Rubber to road time. I followed the directions literally and took the name of the repo using HTTPS and stuck a 2 on the end of it for the SSH remote. As I suspected, git didn’t like that when I tried to push my commits. I took the 2 off and all was well. To reiterate, if you have a remote that looks like this when you do a <code>git remote -v</code></p>

<pre><code>origin  https://github.com/palmolivemadge/ur-soaking-in-it.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/palmolivemadge/ur-soaking-in-it.git (push)
</code></pre>

<p>don’t do this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:palmolivemadge/ur-soaking-in-it2.git
</code></pre>

<p>Note the 2 on the end, just like what GH said in its post. Instead, do this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:palmolivemadge/ur-soaking-in-it.git
</code></pre>

<p>There are probably excellent reasons for GH describing things the way they did, but for us poor, literal-minded souls, they are a little misleading. It’s an easy mistake to spot and fix, but sometimes the dumbest things hang up the smartest people.</p>

<p>The follow-up to this will be altering the rake tasks in Octopress to use the SSH repo instead of the HTTPS. Enough pesky passwords!</p>

<p>Hey. Not so bad for my first substantial post, and only one day in. Onward!</p>
