Somewhere in the wagon-load of ideas and notions I have banging around inside my head, there's a higher notion of what I want to put in this post and in the larger blog. I've started the post a couple of times and it keeps getting bogged down or sidetracked in minutiae. Keeping a blog is an idea I've always liked. Moreso than just a simple journal, having a public accounting of my activity, I think, is good way to keep me on track. Distractions abound, so I'm going to keep this simple.

The idea of an arbitrary or recurring schedule (think [Thing a Week](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/primer/thing-a-week/), if you're JoCo inclined) for blogging appeals to me at this point in the process, mainly because I'm out of the habit and there are lots of things, workflow-wise, that a stipulated schedule could give things the needed nudge. So, in that spirit, let's see if I can get on some sort of weekly schedule - minimum one post a week.

I do have a few expectations:

- get better with Jekyll/Octopress - surprisingly lots to know here.
- sort out where the blog is going to go. Yep, nothing like building the boat as it's pulling away from the dock.
- post successes, or at least progress, however minimal. This one could be tricky, since I'm working with a few things like Go and Python at a *really* basic level. In my other life, I'm a full-time senior .Net dev, operating at a level far above where I am with those other languages. Sometimes it's hard to get enthusiastic about "Look! I can put a Fibonacci sequence to the console!"
- try to have fun with it. There are a lot of places to get technical advice. For the things I'm interested in, I'm a ways from a level of proficiency that anyone would find useful. In the absence of being helpful, my aim is to be at least a bit amusing. If I can't do that, then there's probably not much point to this little exercise.

What I don't expect:

- to take the web by storm. There are boatloads of blogs out there on just the things I'm interested in. No one in my family will read this and even if they did I can't say they'd find much of interest. With a ready-built audience out of the question, I'll have to plug away it in anonymity. Good thing I'm in it for the lulz (ew, forget I said that).
