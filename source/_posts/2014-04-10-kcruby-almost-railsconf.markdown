Tuesday night's meeting was a pleasingly mixed bag, although I think <a href="http://www.meetup.com/kcruby/events/160767342/?comment_table_id=336652532&comment_table_name=event_comment">Craig's critique</a> is a shade overly harsh. His presentation on Docker was illuminating for me, even if it didn't all go as planned. Docker is one of those things I've heard about and tried to figure out if or how I could use it. For the last few days, I've been messing around with a Debian vm trying to get it set up for NewGenLib, which I <a href="/blog/2014/04/08/test-installing-newgenlib/">mentioned yesterday</a> and I'm wondering if Docker might be an alternative to wrestling with Virtualbox. Not that I have anything against databases, but I don't need an instance of Postgres running locally, for the most part. 

Ideally, once I get the thing stood up, I want to give Digital Ocean a go. At this point, I also have to acknowledge that this may all be overkill for what's being requested, but given their history with library databases, I don't want them stuck with something that will peter out after a couple of years.

Yeah, this post was lacking in substance, but I'm still getting into the swing of it. The Octopress workflow takes a little getting used to.
