## 2014-10-22
- something got a bit messed up over the last couple days
  - I may have inadvertantly rm'd the ```_deploy``` folder
  - after trying to fix it and finding that the site no longer updated, decided to nuke/start over
  - yeah.
- back on track - had to remove GH repo and redo
  - lost commit history, but it was brief anyway
  - I suspect there’s a git way to retain all that from the local copy of the old repo, but I’m just glad to be back up
- new post Octopress and the ```_deploy``` folder

- posted Updating the Blog Setup to use SSH
- created a couple of drafts for analytics and rake using ssh

  - looks like the bullet points didn’t get formatted correctly
  - found that md requires a blank line above (although this page seems to behave fine. hm.)

- started blog roll

## 2014-08-29
- started an mGSD wiki
- contemplating a refocus of the blog’s topics
  - something a bit more fun for me to work on
  - debating putting it into this project or keeping it separate
    - currently sitting under Spider Oak; more accessible from multiple machines

## 2014-06-13 Fri
- recovered blog after mistakenly merging master into source
  - Octopress doesn't like that; don't do it again
  - still need to figure out how to get Octopress updates
  - site has proper instructions for all this, I'm sure
