(put something here to contextify)

The point is, where I am is a ways from where I would like to be, in terms of doing what I do for a living. I (make a decent living) as a .Net dev and for the most part I enjoy it. I enjoy the people I work with and the company I work for. When I get home, though, the last thing I want to do is write about or even study .Net. Career-wise, this has a "shit or get off the pot feel to it." If this is what I'm going to do, then it kind of behooves me to spend the time and be as good as I can at it. When I look at something like Python or Go or Ruby, I get genuinely excited. They do things that are pretty cool without a lot of constraints - yeah, technically, you don't need Visual Studio or even Windows to write .Net code, but when I think about it, it gives me this "ugh" feeling.
