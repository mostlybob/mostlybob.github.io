## After some consideration...
I’m thinking about taking this blog in a somewhat different direction to see how it goes. I expect there will still be a fair bit of programming to it, since it’s what I do and what I like. Writing about programming, at least writing about it in a fashion that I would be happy with, is tricky, though. There are tons of really great writing out there on the subject. I’m pretty amazed to see the volume and quality of writing on the web for free and what strikes me about it is that the authors who do it well are writing from a place of passion. That’s what I want for this little piece of web space: a place that reflects my voice in a manner consistent with my interests.

At its core, this is still a programming blog. As I said, it’s what I do. The things that interest me about programming, though, go beyond the minutiae of some framework or language. And honestly, I’m not sure that’s where my strengths lie as a writer. If I’m going to put the time and effort to posting something, I want it to be something I’d want to read myself.

So, what’s all this mean? As of this writing, I’ve worked up a short list of topics that I think should be interesting to write about and (hopefully) interesting to read:

  * Care & Feeding of Your Programmer
  * Stats is Fun!
  * The Next Generation
  * We Are Not As Smart As We Think We Are
  * Lighten Up Already!
  * We’re Smarter Than We Think (and better looking too)
  * Favourite Punchlines
  * Open Data - Waaaayyy Open Data

... with more to come, I expect.

It’s early going yet and all this is subject to change. And who knows, it might just go up in a tiny puff of smoke anyway. Ah, the creative process!
