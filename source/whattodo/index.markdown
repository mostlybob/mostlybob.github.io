I frequently find myself in exactly this position and rather than waste time surfing reddit or youtube or whatever, I'm going to compile a list of things that I can do instead.

## Blog
This should be a duh, but it's still not a habit. And really, no one's looking, especially, so it's not like anyone will complain. A bit of useless content never hurt anyone and it's all about laying down the habits.

## Katas / Koans
There's no shortage of these, from Ruby Koans, to (pragprog's) katas, to Project Euler. The koans are particularly good for these short bursts of activity.

## Research a framework method
Git has all sorts of nooks and crannies that I never use, but could probably stand. Rails? Same. Same for RSpec and so on. 

## Brainstorm something to present
I have a long-standing desire to get a bit more into presenting. I could do worse than jot down a few ideas for a lightning talk or something more involved.
